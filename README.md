# Telly-scope!

Telly-scope is a quick tv show search engine that allows the user to input the title of a tv show and returns the available online platforms to stream the show.

There's no database for this site.  This is a front-end only website written in javascript.  We used the Guidebox API - using the development testing key has limitations.  We are only allowed one API call per second (this is why the search takes a bit longer that it should even though we're ajax-ing the results).

A pending feature is adding the Netflix api.
