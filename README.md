# Telly-scope!

Telly-scope is a quick tv show search engine that allows the user to input the title of a tv show and returns the available online platforms to stream the show.

There's no database for this site.  This is a front-end only website written in javascript.  We used the Guidebox API - using a development testing key has certain limitations.  We're only allowed one API call per second (this is why the search takes longer than it should) and limited to 250 calls per day.

A pending feature is to add the Netflix api.
